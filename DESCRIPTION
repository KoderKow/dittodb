Description: Testing and documenting code that communicates with remote
  databases can be painful. Dealing with authentication, server state,
  and other complications can make testing seem too costly to
  bother with. But it doesn't need to be that hard. This package enables one
  to test all of the logic on the R sides of the database in your package
  without requiring access to the remote service. It also allows one to safely
  record real query results to use as test fixtures. The ability to save
  query results and load them offline also enables one to write vignettes and
  other dynamic documents that can be distributed without access to a live
  server.
